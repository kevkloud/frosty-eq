/** The equaliser section.

    The bands are NOT three biquads in series. In the original, all three live
    in a single passive LC network sitting in the feedback path of one gain
    stage, so their branch admittances sum:

        H(s) = (1 + SUM  g_i * B_i(s)) / (1 + SUM (1/g_i) * B_i(s))

    where B_i is branch i's response normalised to peak at 1.0 and g_i is that
    band's linear gain. Two properties fall out of this that cascaded biquads
    cannot reproduce, and they are most of why the hardware sounds the way it
    does:

      - Band interaction. Boosting the mid and the high shelf together yields
        less than the sum of the two curves where they overlap, because both
        branches load the same feedback path. It is why the unit stays civil
        under EQ moves that would make a clean digital EQ harsh.

      - Proportional Q. The realised bell narrows as gain increases, without
        anyone having to model that as a special case.

    Realisation. Rather than multiplying the rational functions out into a
    sixth-order IIR (which would need root-finding on every coefficient change),
    the structure is preserved directly as a zero-delay feedback loop around the
    branch filters:

        u = x - SUM (1/g_i) * B_i(u)        <- denominator
        y = u + SUM  g_i    * B_i(u)        <- numerator

    Each branch reports its response as an affine function of its input,
    b_i = d_i * u + v_i (see Svf::analyse), so the loop resolves in closed form:

        u = (x - SUM (1/g_i) * v_i) / (1 + SUM (1/g_i) * d_i)

    One division per sample, no iteration, and the denominator is provably
    greater than 1 because every d_i and g_i is positive, so it cannot blow up.

    The high- and low-pass filters are separate passive sections in the original
    rather than part of the feedback network, so they sit outside the loop.
