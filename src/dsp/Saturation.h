/** log(cosh(u)), accurate at both ends.

    The obvious stable-for-large-u form, |u| + log1p(exp(-2|u|)) - log 2, is
    catastrophic for small u: the last two terms cancel to the true value of
    u^2/2, which for u near zero is far below the rounding error of either.
    That matters more than it looks, because ADAA divides the difference of two
    antiderivatives by a small dx and so amplifies any error in them by 1/dx.
    With the naive form this plugin had a constant error floor around 5e-4 --
    inaudible at full scale, but 66 % "distortion" on a -60 dBFS signal.

    Writing the correction as log1p(expm1(-2a)/2) keeps both limits exact:
    expm1 and log1p are precisely the routines that do not lose the small
    difference, and at a = 0 the whole term is exactly zero.

/** Asymmetric soft saturation with first-order antiderivative anti-aliasing.

    shape(x) = (tanh(a*x + b) - tanh(b)) / a

    The bias b is what makes this useful. A plain tanh is an odd function and
    produces only odd harmonics; offsetting the operating point breaks that
    symmetry and brings in even ones, second harmonic foremost. That is the
    signature of a single-ended class-A stage, and a large part of why these
    units are described as warm rather than merely distorted -- the second
    harmonic is an octave, so it stays consonant with whatever produced it.

    ADAA: rather than evaluating the nonlinearity pointwise, which generates
    harmonics above Nyquist that fold back as inharmonic rubbish, integrate it
    and take the difference quotient,

        y[n] = (F(x[n]) - F(x[n-1])) / (x[n] - x[n-1])

    which is the average of the shaping function over the segment the signal
    actually traversed. tanh has a closed-form antiderivative, log(cosh(.)), so
    this costs little more than the shaper itself.

        average, magnitude cos(pi*f/fs). That is -3 dB at 12 kHz for a 48 kHz
        chain, and with four saturating stages in series it measured -12 dB
        there: the plugin was quietly acting as a tone control.

        Splitting f(x) = x + residual(x) and anti-aliasing only the residual
        leaves the linear path untouched, so a signal below the knee passes
        with its treble intact. The residual is the distortion itself, so the

/** Transformer.

    The important property, and the one a plain waveshaper cannot reproduce, is
    that a transformer distorts low frequencies far harder than high ones at the
    same voltage. Core flux is the integral of applied voltage, so for a fixed
    level the flux a signal produces falls as 1/f: bass drives the core towards
    its knee while treble never gets near it. Marinair's own figures for the
    T1442 line transformer used in these units show it plainly -- 0.1 % at
    40 Hz against 0.01 % at 1 kHz and 10 kHz, all at +20 dB in.

    So the signal is pre-emphasised into a flux-like domain, saturated there,
    and de-emphasised by the exact inverse. Below the knee the pair cancels and
    the transformer is transparent; above it, the low end compresses and grows
    harmonics while the top stays clean.

    The emphasis is shelved rather than a true integrator: a real core's
    response to flux is not unbounded, and 26 dB of tilt between 25 Hz and
    500 Hz puts the 40 Hz / 1 kHz distortion ratio at very nearly the 10:1
    Marinair measured.
