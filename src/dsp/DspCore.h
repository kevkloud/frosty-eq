/** Everything the plugin does to audio, with no dependency on JUCE's plugin
    layer or on a host. Takes plain values and raw buffers, so the measurement
    harness and the unit tests can drive the real signal path directly.

    Frequency and gain parameters are smoothed and the filter coefficients are
    recomputed at control rate (once per sub-block) rather than per sample. The
    TPT filters keep their state meaningful across a coefficient change, so a
    stepped selector glides between switch positions instead of clicking. If any
    residual artefact ever shows up, the fallback is to crossfade between two
    network instances over ~10 ms.
